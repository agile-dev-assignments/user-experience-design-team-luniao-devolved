## Travel Wise User Experience Design

### Wireframes

#### Login
This is the very first screen users will encounter when opening the app for the first time. It simply asks for the user's email and password, and allows for them to press the login button. If the user does not already have an account, then they can choose to sign up.

#### Sign Up
If the user opts to create a new account, we will ask for their name, email, birthdate (to provide appropriate activity suggestions), and for them to create a password, which they will have to confirm by entering it a second time. Once they have filled in the required information, then they will automatically be logged in and can access the rest of the app as if they already had an account.

#### Dashboard
The dashboard is where the user will be directed to once they are logged in, and is a home base for all of their adventures. The top of the screen will show any friend activity. Additionally, this is where the user will see the options to create a new trip, view their past and current trips, or view their profile.

#### Profile
On their profile, users will be able to view all of their account details (name, birthdate) and view any past posts they have made. Additionally, they can create a new post.

#### Edit Profile
Viewers can opt to edit their profile, which will allow them to update their email, change their picture, or change their password. They can also update their preferences here by clicking the "Preferences" button, which will take them to their preferences screen.
