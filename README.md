### Wireframes

#### Login
This is the very first screen users will encounter when opening the app for the first time. It simply asks for the user's email and password, and allows for them to press the login button. If the user does not already have an account, then they can choose to sign up.

#### Sign Up
If the user opts to create a new account, we will ask for their name, email, birthdate (to provide appropriate activity suggestions), and for them to create a password, which they will have to confirm by entering it a second time. Once they have filled in the required information, then they will automatically be logged in and can access the rest of the app as if they already had an account.

#### Dashboard
The dashboard is where the user will be directed to once they are logged in, and is a home base for all of their adventures. The top of the screen will show any friend activity. Additionally, this is where the user will see the options to create a new trip, view their past and current trips, or view their profile.

#### Profile
On their profile, users will be able to view all of their account details (name, birthdate, friends list) and view any past posts they have made. Additionally, they can create a new post.

Viewers can opt to edit their profile, which will allow them to update their email, change their picture, or change their password. They can also update their preferences here by clicking the "Preferences" button, which will take them to their preferences screen.

#### Create Trip
This is the main page for the user who want to create a new trip. The user has the option to add new friends, create a poll, or ask for a recommendation. Below is the current to-do list of what the user needs to do before the itinerary is completed. The user can easily manage the list by checking the box if the task is completed.

#### Add Friends
The user can easily add friends by finding their names registered onto the app. The user can then assign the administrative level based on the occasion (i.e casual trip or business trip). If the user wants friends to have no access to editing the trip, the user can assign them as attendees. If the user wants friends to also edit, the user assigns them as admins. Lastly, if the user no longer wants to be the owner, the user can give away the position and become an admin.

#### Create Poll
If the user already has some options (i.e flight tickets, hotels), the user can create a poll so that the group can vote. The user needs to write the name of the poll and the end date and also search specific name or an id (i.e flight number, hotel name) so that the group does not get confused. Once the names are added, the user can create a poll.

#### Ask for Rec
If the user does not have much idea of where/when/how to travel, the user can ask for recommendations. The user is asked to provide the topic the user needs help with, budget limit, and the date so that the data can be extracted specifically. After the user types in all the required information, the user is given several options to choose from and can select one to add onto the checklist.
